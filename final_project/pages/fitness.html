                    <h2>Top Tips</h2><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Don't overdo it! A common mistake that many make, is working out too hard and too often. Remember to stretch, give your body time to rest, and find a workout plan that is sustainable.</li>

                        <li>Take a group fitness class. They come in all forms so you can choose what interests you and the level of difficulty. You'll learn from others, break a sweat, and feel amazing!</li>
