                <h2><a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/food-essentials/five-food-groups" target="_blank">Major Food Groups</a></h2><p>One way to find balance is to incorporate foods from major food groups:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>vegetables</dt>
                        <dd>"Vegetables, including legumes/beans are nutrient dense, low in kilojoules, and are a good source of minerals and vitamins (such as magnesium, vitamin C and folate), dietary fibre and a range of phytochemicals including carotenoids."</dd> 
                    <dt>fruit</dt>
                        <dd>"Most fruits are low in energy (kilojoules) and high in fibre and water, making you feel fuller. This reduces the risk of over eating which can cause weight gain. The fibre in fruit is also thought to reduce the risk of some cancers, including colorectal cancer."</dd> 
                    <dt>grain</dt>
                        <dd>"Grain foods are mostly made from wheat, oats, rice, rye, barley, millet, quinoa and corn.  The different grains can be cooked and eaten whole, ground into flour to make a variety of cereal foods like bread, pasta and noodles, or made into ready-to-eat breakfast cereals."</dd> 
                    <dt>lean meat and poultry</dt>
                        <dd>"Foods from this high protein food group (Lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds, and legume/beans) often form the main part of a meal, particularly in the evening or for the largest meal of the day."</dd> 
                    <dt>dairy</dt>
                        <dd>"Milk, cheese and yoghurt provide calcium in a readily absorbable and convenient form.  They also have various health benefits and are a good source of many nutrients, including calcium, protein, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and zinc."</dd>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Water is your bestfriend! Stay hydrated - cut back on caffeine and sugary drinks to instantly feel less sluggish and to avoid drinking excess calories!</li>
                        <li>The key to transitioning into a healthy diet is to find ways to substitute the foods you love! If you can't live without pancakes and syrup for breakfast, try making gluten free, whole-grain pancakes with sugar free syrup instead!</li>
                        <li>Listen to your body and use food as your fuel source. Next time you choose a food or meal, think "How is this going to make me feel? Will this energize me or make me feel fatigued? Will I stay full after eating this or quickly need a snack?"</li>
